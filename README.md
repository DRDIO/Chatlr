	apt-get install git-core build-essential libssl-dev

	# Install node.js
	apt-get install nodejs npm
	npm install -g n forever
	
	# Switch node to the latest stable release (0.6.14 in this example)
	n 0.6.14 

	# install Chatlr
	cd /usr/src
	git clone git://github.com/DRDIO/Chatlr.git

	# Setup Chatlr
	cd Chatlr
	cp conf/app.conf.bu.js conf/app.conf.js

	# Open config/config.js and set up the custom fields
